## Project Status

**Early Phase (Work in Progress)**  
InlineDB is currently in its **first development phase**.  
⚠️ Nothing much works yet — features are still being designed and implemented.  

---

## Vision

- **One binary** → run it and you’re ready to go.  
- **Self-hosted** → full control over your data.  
- **SQLite3 powered** → minimal, file-based database.  
- **Open Source** → extend, modify, and improve freely.  
- **HTMX frontend** → lightweight and fast (no React/Next.js overhead).  
- **Serverless functions (planned)** → embed backend logic directly.  

---

## Why InlineDB?

- Supabase/Firebase are powerful but not simple to self-host.  
- PostgreSQL often adds unnecessary complexity for small/medium projects.  
- PocketBase is nice, but SDK limitations and DX issues can get in the way.  
- InlineDB focuses on **simplicity and control first**.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Go  
- **Database:** SQLite3  
- **Frontend:** HTMX  
- **Distribution:** Single static binary

## Roadmap

- [ ] Core database API  
- [ ] Basic authentication & user management  
- [ ] HTMX admin UI  
- [ ] Embedded serverless functions  
- [ ] Packaging into single binary
